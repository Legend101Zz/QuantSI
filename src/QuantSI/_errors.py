class DimensionMismatchError(Exception):
    """
    Exception class for attempted operations with inconsistent dimensions.

    For example, ``3*mvolt + 2*amp`` raises this exception. The purpose of this
    class is to help catch errors based on incorrect units. The exception will
    print a representation of the dimensions of the two inconsistent objects
    that were operated on.

    Parameters
    ----------
    description : ``str``
        A description of the type of operation being performed, e.g. Addition,
        Multiplication, etc.
    dims : `Dimension`
        The physical dimensions of the objects involved in the operation, any
        number of them is possible
